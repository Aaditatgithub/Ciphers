## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## Simplified DES (S-DES)

Simplified DES (S-DES) is a simplified version of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. It is used for educational purposes to illustrate the basic concepts of the DES algorithm.
